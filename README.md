2. Download one of the following:
   - **`Windows Sound Controller-Setup-X.X.X.exe`** - Full installer with desktop shortcut
   - **`Windows Sound Controller-Portable-X.X.X.exe`** - Portable version (no installation required)

3. **Important:** Install the required PowerShell module:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: `Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets -Force`

4. Run the application!

### For Developers

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ installed
- PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets module (see above)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/windows-sound-profile-manager.git
cd windows-sound-profile-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

# Build installers
npm run dist
```

## Usage

### Creating a Profile

1. Click the **"+ Add New Profile"** button
2. Enter a name for your profile (e.g., "Studio Setup", "Gaming", "Oculus VR")
3. Select your desired playback device from the dropdown
4. Select your desired recording device from the dropdown
5. Click **"Save Profile"**

### Applying a Profile

Simply click the **"Apply"** button on any profile card. The application will:
- Set your default playback device
- Set your default recording device
- Show a success message when complete
- Update the device list to show the new defaults (marked with a checkmark)

### Example Profiles

**Profile 1: Studio Setup**
- Playback: Scarlett Solo 4th Gen
- Recording: Sennheiser Profile

**Profile 2: VR Gaming**
- Playback: Oculus Virtual Audio Device
- Recording: Oculus Virtual Audio Device

### Managing Profiles

- **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button on any profile to remove it
- **Refresh Devices**: Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Devices" button to reload the list of available audio devices

## How It Works

This application uses:
- **Electron** for the desktop GUI framework
- **PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets** to control Windows audio devices
- **Node.js** to bridge the GUI and PowerShell scripts

The app directly controls the Windows Sound control panel settings, setting the default playback and recording devices system-wide.

## Building for Distribution

### Local Build

To create installers locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build both installer and portable versions
npm run dist
```

This will create in the `dist/` folder:
- `Windows Sound Controller-Setup-X.X.X.exe` - NSIS installer
- `Windows Sound Controller-Portable-X.X.X.exe` - Portable executable

### Automated GitHub Releases

This project includes GitHub Actions automation:

1. **Create a new release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the Windows installer and portable exe
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Attach the executables to the release

3. Users can then download from the Releases page!
